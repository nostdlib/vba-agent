# Responsible Use Policy

## Purpose

vba-agent is developed and maintained for the following legitimate purposes:

- **Education** -- Studying Office VBA automation, COM automation surfaces, HTTP command-and-control protocol design, and defensive detection engineering against document-macro implants
- **Authorized Security Testing** -- Supporting professional penetration testers and red team operators who hold explicit written authorization from the system owner to conduct security assessments
- **Capture The Flag (CTF) Competitions** -- Providing a reference for techniques commonly encountered in offensive security competitions held in controlled, sanctioned environments
- **Academic and Independent Research** -- Enabling security researchers to study, document, and develop defenses against real-world offensive techniques in a transparent, open-source context

Detection engineering against this agent should start with [DEFENSE.md](DEFENSE.md).
